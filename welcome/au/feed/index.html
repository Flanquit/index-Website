Educators strongly believe it helps them to do their jobs better, engage students and improve behaviour.</h2>
<p>Here are 5 edtech trends to watch in 2020:</p>
<p><strong>1. Improved information accessibility</strong></p>
<p>With such advances in accessibility tools, there’s a controversial argument as to whether pupils even need to learn to read these days.</p>
<p>The answer is yes, of course. But it does help you realise how well technology aids students with learning difficulties and disabilities. Next year, expect to see more accessible information and knowledge through tech. This includes voice-to-text and text-to-voice tools that are especially helpful to pupils suffering with dyslexia and other learning issues.</p>
<p><strong>2. Circular economy of edtech</strong></p>
<p>With improved tech-savviness but stretched budgets, schools are getting smarter with their edtech investments.</p>
<p>To direct budget to where it’s most needed, next year more schools will learn to harness what edtech they already have. This means, instead of the common ‘buy, use, dispose’ approach, more schools will adopt a reuse model.</p>
<p>This could mean refurbishing devices or investing in upgradeable tech like a <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">Promethean ActivPanel</a>. This will create a more circular economy, and put schools in better control of their IT strategy.</p>
<p><strong>3. Evidence-based tech procurement</strong></p>
<p>As well as maximising their existing technologies, we expect schools to make more informed procurement decisions in 2020.</p>
<p>Schools are much more likely to invest in technology based on evidence that it supports their school’s learning requirements and challenges. At a time when budgets are incredibly tight, school leaders want to know that the technology they spend money on will support them with the outcomes they need, as well as integrate easily within their existing infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tech to improve collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Technology that pupils use outside the classroom is collaborative and social, so why shouldn’t edtech mirror this?</p>
<p>More and more, educators expect edtech to foster connections between students and their peers. Technologies that encourage teamwork, collaboration and social skills will set children up with the soft skills to succeed in the workplace beyond education.</p>
<p><strong>5. More ‘ed’. Less ‘tech’</strong></p>
<p>For over a decade, there’s been an explosion in startup companies offering cutting-edge tech for schools. Many of these small enterprises will proudly demo technical capabilities, clever tricks and amazing graphics. Unfortunately, a large number forget to link their product back to a core pedagogy.</p>
<p>These tools have minimal longevity as they are too detached from the primary job that teachers do every day; planning, assessing and teaching. Now that educators see how technology can make their jobs easier and enrich their pupils’ learning, they have less time for gimmicks or fads.</p>
<p>This year, in line with schools looking for evidence-based procurement, there will be a higher number of educational-based tools available that are entirely focused on learning goals and the curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, which edtech trend might schools leave behind?</strong></p>
<p>The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model rose in popularity a few years ago. As so many students owned smartphones or tablets, schools saw an opportunity to introduce more tech and reduce costs at the same time.</p>
<p>The downside? Personal devices are widely considered a distraction in schools. If pupils are using phones for everyday social activities, they are focusing less on their learning. In some cases, the benefits of the technology are not outweighed by the challenges.</p>
<p>Also, unless a school is using an interactive hub in the classroom, mobile devices are minimally collaborative. More schools are realising that if tech should help pupils develop soft skills, there are more effective technologies than personal smartphones.</p>
<p>On top of this, connecting a number of personal devices to a school network can be a far greater security risk than using a school-owned fleet of devices, or one interactive display. Unless thoroughly firewalled with enterprise-level security, schools may open themselves up to data theft or GDPR non-compliance.</p>
<p>Instead, more schools will consider reuse or refurbishment of school-owned tablets or laptops, using collaborative technologies, interactive displays like a <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">Promethean ActivPanel</a>, all supported by free or low-cost educational apps.</p>

Find out how common school tech will help you reach your goals.</h2>
<p>Are you and your pupils working towards a growth mindset in the classroom? More than just a passing buzz, a growth mindset is the concept that intelligence can be developed, not simply set in stone. It’s a useful tool for motivation by raising pupils’ expectations and encouraging them at the same time.</p>
<p>As a tech-focused teacher, no doubt you’re an advocate for using the edtech in your classroom to improve overall learning outcomes. But have you considered how the same tech can be used to develop a growth mindset too?</p>
<p>While a growth mindset is a relatively new focus in education, as a concept it’s far from new. The term was first coined by Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford, who made a breakthrough discovery in the course of researching children’s performance in the 1970s.</p>
<p>In the study, children who were praised for their intelligence said they enjoyed tasks less than the children who had been praised for their effort. Children who had been praised for their effort, meanwhile, tended to choose further tasks that would help them learn new things.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when students understand that abilities are developed rather than innate, they are more likely to adopt behaviours that help them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>So, how can you use tech in your classroom to develop a growth mindset?</p>
<p><strong>1. Encourage pupils to challenge themselves</strong><br />
Your pupils will only understand how to adopt a growth mindset by working outside of their comfort zones.</p>
<p>By encouraging your pupils to use digital platforms they are less familiar with, or using online apps to work with traditionally paper-based subjects, they are developing their knowledge on the subject as well as their use of digital tools. <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">The Promethean ActivPanel</a>, through the ActivConnect-G, provides teachers with full access to the Google Play store and can also be connected to students’ iPads, smartphones, laptops and other devices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Get your class to take risks</strong><br />
Many edtech platforms and online applications can empower your pupils to set their tasks at their own pace, monitor their own progress, and choose their own activities anonymously from a list of options at lower and more challenging difficulty levels. This level of self-management and sense of privacy may result in students taking greater risks in their learning and trying out more on challenging activities as they progress.</p>
<p><strong>3. Work around setbacks</strong><br />
Tasks requiring more effort encourage pupils to grow, and effort is a function of a growth mindset. With this, of course, will come a degree of failure the first time around. Encourage your pupils to research and find a ‘plan b’ when they experience a setback.</p>
<p>Tasks like starting a class blog, for example, take time and patience to see reward. If your pupils want to grow an audience they will need to continue to learn ways to drive engagement. The more your students get excited by and creative with their blogging, their skills will continue to advance.</p>
<p><strong>4. Encourage collaborative working</strong><br />
Outside the classroom, children use technology to collaborate and to socialise. Thanks to the power of the internet, pupils can now work together with classes from different schools, or even across the other side of the world. Increasingly, we’re seeing the use of similar tech in the classroom, enabling children to learn from one another whilst engaging in learning.</p>
<p>The trend towards digital flipped learning — encouraging pupils to engage with digital content outside the classroom then providing a more interactive classroom as a result — promotes a growth mindset and a sense of responsibility for learning.</p>
<p><strong>5. Welcome constructive criticism</strong><br />
Collaborative edtech platforms, like those on <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/lesson-delivery-software/classflow/">ClassFlow</a>, can help you provide ongoing feedback in private to your pupils through progress monitoring tools.</p>
<p>These also include screens at the completion of a task acknowledging the student’s effort, or a ticker that shows how many activities are completed and remaining to motivate them.</p>
<p><strong>6. Promote others’ successes</strong><br />
By using digital rewards and badges in the software on your ActivPanel, students can celebrate each other’s successes. Push your pupils to offer help when there is a challenging task, or be peer mentors for one another.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of the growth mindset is its pure simplicity — we should all consider our own abilities like a muscle that can change and grow. A growth mindset empowers pupils to prepare for the future, learn new skills, and overcome challenges.</p>
<p>With more edtech like a <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">Promethean ActivPanel</a> at your fingertips, you can easily encourage self-management in your pupils and provide constructive feedback that develops their own growth mindsets.</p>

<p>We have long acknowledged that education technologies are best used to enhance teaching and learning environments &#8211; not to detract from the role of a teacher. There are a wide range of technologies available to you on the market and it can be easy to be overwhelmed by the bright lights of the latest edtech gadgets, but the magic happens where there is a strategy in place to ensure the right solution is chosen. Investing in the right technology that meets the needs of the schools, its teachers and students is crucial.</p>
<p>Here are four key considerations schools should make before investing in new classroom technology:</p>
<p><strong>1. Using Edtech as an Enabler</strong><br />
Investing in technology is a big decision for schools, so it’s important that you’re doing it for the right reasons. At Promethean, we know that technology is best used when it makes the lives of teachers a little easier and helps to deliver innovative and engaging lessons that are proven to improve learning outcomes. 9 in 10 educators who took part in the Promethean State of Technology in Education Report 2019/20 agreed technology helps them do their job better. Think carefully about what teachers and learners are looking to gain from new technology and seek options that best suit these needs.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Connected Classroom</strong><br />
One of the main factors that should be considered when selecting new technology should be whether it will integrate with your current provisions. Can you use the same software as you do now, and will the new technology boast connectivity with existing class devices? It can help to do an audit of what you already have – you can then keep this in mind when making purchasing decisions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Get All Teachers Involved</strong><br />
This is really important. As the primary user of teaching technologies, teachers need to participate in the procurement process and have the chance to get a feel for edtech solutions being considered. Staff should be given the opportunity to decide whether the functionality and usability meets their needs and those of students. By including teachers in the buying process, they are more likely to become advocates of the edtech you’re investing in and will be more confident and resourceful using the new technology.</p>
<p><strong>4. Choose the Right Edtech Partner</strong><br />
When investing in new technology it pays dividends to think about the wider value edtech providers offer, as well as choosing an established edtech partner that is going to be around for the lifetime of the technology you’re investing in. Promethean hosts a suite of free online training materials for schools to help you get the most out of your edtech investment, as well as supplying award-winning lesson delivery platform <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/lesson-delivery-software/activinspire/">ActivInspire</a> as standard with every ActivPanel. We also pioneer education initiatives like the Promethean Grant – giving schools the chance to win free edtech &#8211; and State of Technology in Education Report – providing a fresh insight into the thoughts of educators across Australia.</p>
<p>Through strategic planning, consideration and taking the time to evaluate what edtech solutions will make the biggest impact in the classroom, you can be confident you’re making the right edtech investment. Edtech is always the most effective when implemented carefully – feel free to <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/how-to-buy/">get in touch</a> with us if you’d like to find out more about how we can support you through procurement.</p>

<p>Toronto Adventist School saw off challengers from across Australia to claim victory in the Promethean Grant competition. As a result, the local school has been awarded a state-of-the-art education technology package worth $5,000AUD by global edtech provider, Promethean.</p>
<p>The Promethean Grant has run in Australia since 2017 as part of a global initiative designed to help schools celebrate a love for learning while supporting them with new edtech solutions.</p>
<p>Through the competition, Promethean aims to reduce the mounting pressures of school budgets and teacher workload by equipping schools with effective edtech solutions. The latest Promethean Grant competition gave schools in Australia the chance to win a fully-installed <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">ActivPanel</a> with award-winning <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/lesson-delivery-software/activinspire/">ActivInspire</a> software, training and ongoing support. The competition also gave teachers an opportunity for teachers to recognise the successes of education.</p>
<p>To win the Promethean Grant 2019, Toronto Adventist School produced a two-minute video covering an inspirational educational moment. Andrea Thompson, Teacher at Toronto Adventist School, spoke about a newsroom project she set up with students. Andrea’s students ran a newsroom for the school, applying for and taking on various roles within the project, and becoming incredibly engaged with the hands-on learning involved.</p>
<p>Toronto Adventist School had been considering options to upgrade their technology equipment. Andrea and her colleagues were well aware of the benefits of front of class technologies, and lamented the lack of interactivity associated with their aging equipment. The Promethean Grant gave the school a chance to introduce new edtech solutions ahead of its proposed timeline for upgrading current resources.</p>
<p>Andrea commented on the school’s Promethean Grant success, saying: “Winning this competition means a lot to our school. Because we are a very small school, we have limited budget to update our technology. So, being chosen as a winning entry to the Promethean Grant is a big deal – having a brand new ActivPanel means that all children within the school from pre-kindergarten through to year six will benefit. We can’t wait to explore interactive learning!”</p>
<p>Alistair Hayward, Promethean’s Head of UKI and ANZ Markets, spoke on the latest competition: “The Promethean Grant is a brilliant opportunity for us to reach out to teachers, learn more about their successes, and also give something back. Running the competition over the past few years has been an immense experience, and I am sure our two latest winners will use their ActivPanels to great effect.”</p>
<p>Toronto Adventist School is planning to mount its ActivPanel on a mobile stand so that it can be shared between the school’s three classrooms. Students in Andrea’s class were overjoyed at hearing that their school won the competition, and proud to share the news with parents and the local community.</p>

<p>Swan Hill Specialist School saw off challengers from across Australia to claim victory in the Promethean Grant competition. As a result, the local school has been awarded a state-of-the-art education technology package worth $5,000AUD by global edtech provider, Promethean.</p>
<p>The Promethean Grant has run in Australia since 2017 as part of a global initiative designed to help schools celebrate a love for learning while supporting them with new edtech solutions. Through the competition, Promethean aims to reduce the mounting pressures of school budgets and teacher workload by equipping schools with effective edtech solutions.</p>
<p>The latest Promethean Grant competition gave schools in Australia the chance to win a fully-installed <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/interactive-displays/activpanel/">ActivPanel</a> with award-winning <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/au/products/lesson-delivery-software/activinspire/">ActivInspire</a> software, training and ongoing support. The competition also gave teachers an opportunity for teachers to recognise the successes of education.</p>
<p>To win the Promethean Grant 2019, Swan Hill Specialist School produced a two-minute video covering an inspirational educational moment. Amanda Dalton, Teaching and Learning Coach at Swan Hill Specialist School, recorded a moving video about a student with additional learning needs growing in confidence after moving from a mainstream school.</p>
<p>Swan Hill Specialist School is a small, rural school which caters to students with diverse range of needs. Swan Hill has identified Promethean’s ActivPanel as an invaluable front-of-class solution suitable for all of its students, whether they are in a wheelchair, have dyspraxia or benefit from a larger screen.</p>
<p>Amanda commented on the school’s Promethean Grant success, saying: “It’s fantastic because it was a great opportunity to talk about my own experiences as a teacher and what I love about teaching. I’m proud of the relationships that I have with our students and it’s so nice that my account of how I could see a child’s confidence grow was recognised as a significant story.</p>
<p>“Alistair Hayward, Promethean’s Head of UKI and ANZ Markets, spoke on the latest competition: “The Promethean Grant is a brilliant opportunity for us to reach out to teachers, learn more about their successes, and also give something back. Running the competition over the past few years has been an immense experience, and I am sure our two latest winners will use their ActivPanels to great effect.”</p>
<p>Teachers at Swan Hill Specialist School are looking forward to using their new ActivPanel, and the school is on target to install an ActivPanel in every classroom by the start of 2020. Winning the Promethean Grant has accelerated the process, and freed up some of the school’s budget for other resources.</p>

<p>Rockhampton, Australia, is home to The Hall State School – where there are around 325 students from preparatory level up to Year 6. The Hall is committed to treating every student as an individual and offers a range of activities around creating a positive impact, including a school-wide recycling program and a whole-school social-emotional wellbeing program.</p>
<p>The Hall is keen to keep up with developments in education technology, and has access to a range of online resources and a few interactive whiteboards across the school. That said, looking for ways to upgrade technology on a tight budget is no mean feat &#8211; until teacher Emily Leschke found out about the Promethean Grant!</p>
<p>Having previously met with one of the Promethean team and seen an ActivPanel demonstration, Emily was convinced that it would be a brilliant addition to her classroom. “We didn’t have budget to purchase one ourselves,” she explained, “but we were overwhelmed by the potential of the technology.”</p>
<p>Emily was looking to introduce a more interactive classroom experience, and recognised the potential for the ActivPanel to provide a platform through which the students could work together and share ideas. On top of this, Emily was looking for technology which could help streamline workloads for herself and her fellow teachers by bringing their resources together and enabling seamless lesson planning and delivery on the fly. With the help of her class, Emily put together a winning entry to the 2017 Promethean Grant, and had an ActivPanel installed in her classroom.</p>
<p>The Hall had a few devices available to them already, such as iPads, and Emily found that the ActivPanel worked well with their existing resources. Elaborating on this, Emily added: “As a teacher, I found that the in-class connectivity functions really helped to bring content to life through using the technology to integrate different media and resources.”</p>
<p>The Hall State School’s ActivPanel has enabled Emily and her colleagues to find new ways of engaging and inspiring their students whilst managing their own workloads more effectively. Enthusiastic to maximise the potential of the ActivPanel, Emily has undertaken classes on the interactive benefits of the technology so as to help the staff upskill across the school. Promethean has since recognised her efforts once more by gifting Emily’s class VR shirts at EduTECH 2018, setting them up for a fantastic virtual reality experience.</p>

<p>Based in Forestville, New South Wales, Aspect Vern Barnett School is a specialised school catering to around 130 students of various ages with autism. Aspect Vern Barnett endeavours to foster an open and collaborative environment for staff, parents and students, and works with five satellite classes around Sydney where their pupils go to integrate with mainstream students.</p>
<p>The school is dedicated to meeting the individual needs of all comers, and celebrates the strengths, interests and unique abilities of every learner. Bradley Muffett, a teacher at Aspect Vern Barnett, was among the staff who recognised the capacity for technology to help empower students and provide engaging teaching and learning experiences.In his words: “We love using technology which helps us be interactive and not just consumers with our learning”.</p>
<p>Teachers from Aspect Vern Barnett had seen the ActivPanel showcased at the EduTECH expo, and with the help of their students went on to win one through The Promethean Grant 2017. The ActivPanel worked so well in Bradley’s classroom, in fact, that the school has since invested in installing them in five more classrooms.</p>
<p>Not only did the school’s first ActivPanel lead them to invest in bringing the technology to more classrooms, Aspect Vern Barnett has also been sharing the benefits with other institutions in the Autism Spectrum Australia group. The staff have been keen to showcase how the panel can meet the needs of individual learners, and encourage engagement across the curriculum.</p>
<p>Aspect Vern Barnett School continues to provide fantastic educational experiences for autistic students in Australia, and their use of the ActivPanel to underpin and exact their own values is nothing short of exemplary.</p>

<p>Global education technology provider Promethean has announced that the Promethean Grant will run for the third consecutive year in 2019. The Promethean Grant looks to reward schools putting together creative competition entries with state-of-the-art technology to assist teachers in improving learning experiences. Following the success of 2018’s grant which saw 12 ActivPanels given to winning schools in Australia, Promethean will be celebrating the love for learning that unites teachers worldwide with the Promethean Grant 2019.</p>
<p>Budgetary constraints and teacher workloads in Australia are a hot topic, and Promethean has recognised the opportunity to help alleviate these concerns whilst celebrating the brilliant work that teachers do. This year, the competition encourages educators to share a two-minute video capturing a special memory from their teaching experience, whether it be a student they helped to excel or a project they worked on with a colleague. Entrants will be in with the chance to win a Promethean ActivPanel for their classroom, a state-of-the-art interactive display which can streamline teacher workloads and inspire children in their education.</p>
<p>Alistair Hayward, Promethean&#8217;s Head of UKI and ANZ markets, said: “The response to the 2018 Promethean Grant in Australia was tremendous. We saw a number of very impressive entries, and we were happy to award ActivPanels to 12 schools. The impact that the Promethean Grant can make to these communities is clear, and we are keen to extend this opportunity to new schools in 2019.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Gillen Primary School in Alice Springs was one of the winners of the Promethean Grant. Heather Pedrotti, a primary teacher at Gillen Primary School, shared her thoughts on winning: “We thoroughly enjoyed creating our video entry, we always strive to use technology to enhance our learning but with limited budgets to make technological investments it can be difficult. This was a fantastic opportunity to work together as a class to get the best technology in our classroom and we were incredibly proud to find out that we won!”</p>
<p>Promethean recently ran a special competition at EduTECH 2019 in anticipation of the Promethean Grant. Educators visiting the Promethean stand shared their classroom stories in a short video, entering a prize draw in the hope of winning an ActivPanel. The lucky winner, Peggy Mangovski from Cessnock High School, talked about how teachers might not realise how important their efforts can be to students.

<p>The Promethean Grant 2019 launches on July 23<sup>rd</sup> and will run on a termly basis, with two ActivPanels to be won in each period. Each ActivPanel will be fully installed and the acclaimed ActivInspire and ClassFlow software supplied as standard. The judging criteria for the competition will be the inspirational qualities of each video. A maximum of one ActivPanel can be won per school, but multiple entries are welcomed.</p>
