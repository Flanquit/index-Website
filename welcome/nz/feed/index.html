<p>Northcote Baptist Community Preschool in Auckland has beat off competition from Trans-Tasman schools to become one of the 17 successful winners of the Promethean Grant 2018. With entries from both Australia and New Zealand, Northcote Baptist Community Preschool impressed the panel of judges and won a state-of-the-art education technology package worth $6,000 NZD.</p>
<p><strong>Key considerations</strong></p>
<p>In their video entry, Northcote Baptist Community Preschool’s children explained how an ActivPanel’s large screen would help them with their digital learning and coding; all through the concept of NITs – No Interactive Technology Screens!</p>
<p>Elizabeth Lupton, Lead Teacher at Northcote Baptist Community Preschool said: “We are really excited, this is such a great opportunity for our preschool &#8211; we are so pleased that our video was a success. “We are doing some really amazing things by integrating coding and digital story book making into our daily teaching. Whilst our tablets are a great resource, having a large screen will help the kids to share their work, speak up and outwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Global education technology provider Promethean has announced that the Promethean Grant will run for the third consecutive year in 2019. The Promethean Grant looks to reward schools putting together creative competition entries with state-of-the-art technology to assist teachers in improving learning experiences. Following the success of 2018’s grant which saw 5 ActivPanels given to winning schools in New Zealand, Promethean will be celebrating the love for learning that unites teachers worldwide with the Promethean Grant 2019.</p>
<p>Budgetary constraints and teacher workloads in New Zealand are a hot topic, and Promethean has recognised the opportunity to help alleviate these concerns whilst celebrating the brilliant work that teachers do. This year, the competition encourages educators to share a two-minute video capturing a special memory from their teaching experience, whether it be a student they helped to excel or a project they worked on with a colleague. Entrants will be in with the chance to win a Promethean ActivPanel for their classroom, a state-of-the-art interactive display which can streamline teacher workloads and inspire children in their education.</p>
<p>Alistair Hayward, Promethean&#8217;s Head of UKI and ANZ markets, said: “The response to the 2018 Promethean Grant in New Zealand was tremendous. We saw a number of very impressive entries, and we were happy to award ActivPanels to 5 schools. The impact that the Promethean Grant can make to these communities is clear, and we are keen to extend this opportunity to new schools in 2019.”</p>
<p>Promethean recently ran a special competition at EduTECH 2019 in Sydney in anticipation of the Promethean Grant. Educators visiting the Promethean stand shared their classroom stories in a short video, entering a prize draw in the hope of winning an ActivPanel. The lucky winner, Peggy Mangovski from Cessnock High School, talked about how teachers might not realise how important their efforts can be to students. To see her video entry, click <a href="https://www.PrometheanWorld.com/au/grant/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Promethean Grant 2019 launches on October 9th and will run on a termly basis, with two ActivPanels to be won in each period. Each ActivPanel will be fully installed and the acclaimed ActivInspire and ClassFlow software supplied as standard. The judging criteria for the competition will be the inspirational qualities of each video. A maximum of one ActivPanel can be won per school, but multiple entries are welcomed.</p>

<p>Putaruru College is located in the Waikato Region of New Zealand’s North Island, and is home to around 410 year 7-13 students. The college is founded on values of community and confidence, and strives to instil a sense of involvement and excellence to staff and students alike.</p>
<p>Putaruru College staff felt that the Promethean ActivPanel would suit their needs as they were looking for a flexible hardware and software package that could support learning across the curriculum. Whilst Lanny appreciated that the ActivPanel would be a huge upgrade on the Chromebooks for collective video production work in his film lessons, he also recognised that other departments would also benefit from the technology. The PE department identified the potential to use the ActivPanel for video playback to see the students in action and help develop the sports teams. Crucially, Lanny saw the ActivPanel as a way to help teachers at the college upskill and push interactivity in teaching and learning across the college.</p>
<p>With Lanny leading the charge, the whole school got involved in creating a video entry to The Promethean Grant 2018. The effort put in by staff and students saw them win an ActivPanel, which they decided to place in the library so that everyone would have a chance to use it.</p>
<p>Putaruru College’s ActivPanel is being used every hour and Kim noted that the library is seeing a lot more footfall as a result, drawing children in during breaktimes to play education games. Whilst the staff were a little unsure at first, Kim pointed out that it was an intuitive experience for the students, saying: “The students definitely feel ownership over the ActivPanel and have taken to using it so quickly, instinctively knowing how best to use it and exploring apps and activities.”</p>
<p>Having students work together using the ActivPanel has helped Putaruru College uphold their values of involvement and confidence across the centre, and they are looking to work with other schools who have ActivPanels to share their experiences and seek inspiration to achieve even greater impact on teaching and learning with the technology.</p>

<p>Located in Auckland, New Zealand, Northcote Baptist Community Preschool (NBCP) is dedicated to nurturing and inspiring learners from a young age, and preparing them for primary education. NBCP is dedicated to instilling Christian character and values such as collaboration, excellence and diversity into its young pupils.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Lupton, the Lead Teacher at NBCP, talked about how parents helped clue them in to Promethean technology: “We had heard about Promethean<br />
through parents who had been to a school where they had ActivPanels. Because they knew that we were looking at digital technologies, they helped put Promethean onto our radar.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth, alongside the teaching team at NBCP, wanted a device which would bring clarity to teaching at the preschool and provide a more engaging platform to share feedback whether it be from the teacher or from one child to another.</p>
<p><strong>A digital curriculum powered by ActivPanel</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth and her fellow teachers decided to approach the ActivPanel with the mantra that it was for creating, not consuming.</p>
<p>“We have really got into the rhythm of using it more frequently,” Elizabeth explained, “We have been doing a lot of artwork. We have started using an app where we can screenshot pictures then put them up next to one another, allowing the children to critique and compare their artwork. It’s an amazing thing for 3 and 4 year olds to be engaged with.”</p>
<p>With children and teachers alike building digital skills and working more collaboratively than ever, the ActivPanel has enriched the teaching and learning experience at Northcote Baptist Community Preschool. The school has crafted a digital curriculum focused around the ActivPanel which supports its values and delivers a high quality, nurturing environment for all.</p>

<p>Mangere Bridge School in Auckland has beat off competition from Trans-Tasman schools to become one of the 17 successful winners of the Promethean Grant 2018. With entries from both Australia and  New Zealand, Mangere Bridge School impressed the panel of judges and won a state-of-the-art education technology package worth $6,000 NZD.</p>
<p><strong>Key considerations</strong></p>
<p>In their video entry, which you can see here, Mangere Bridge School rapped about their despair with the school’s current interactive technology – all to the tune of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p>
<p>Robin Tapper, Lead Teacher for Learning with Digital Technologies at Mangere Bridge School said: “We are so delighted &#8211; projects like this are a hard thing to squeeze in during the school day but it was well worth the effort. “I feel that we have lost our way with technology a bit recently, we have been struggling to use what we have effectively because it is now old, so I am hopeful that the new ActivPanel will help us to find a new direction.”</p>

<p><strong>Key considerations</strong></p>
<p>In their video entry, Waikaretu School talked about how the small school had recently been split into two classrooms – leaving one group of students without access to interactive technology. Ron Baptist, Headteacher at Waikaretu School said: “We are thrilled! We are often overlooked as a small rural school so when our fundraising board member passed details of the competition on to me, I thought that it was worth going for.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I’m really proud of the students for their collaborations, their ideas and for presenting our story.”</p>

<p>Torbay School in Auckland’s north shore has won a state-of-the-art education technology package, after entering a Trans-Tasman school competition. The Promethean Grant was an initiative across Australia and New Zealand where schools were asked to submit creative entries as to why they deserved to receive a Promethean ActivPanel – an advanced interactive front of class display. The school has been chosen as one of the 11 winners from a total of 76 entries.</p>
<p>The competition – launched at EduTECH 2017 &#8211; closed in September and entries were judged by a local panel of experienced educators and edtech specialists. The winners’ new ActivPanels were installed in time for start of the next academic term. Each school received a fully installed ActivPanel package, the total Promethean Grant package has been valued at approximately $50,000 NZD.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Mawdsley, teacher</strong><strong> at </strong><strong>Torbay School said: </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Winning the ActivPanel Grant has been such an amazing achievement for the children in my class who love using technology with their learning. They put such a lot of effort into making the video, it has been a great and rewarding experience for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interactivity will support my teaching and extend the learning experience, for example, on the big screen of the panel, it is easy to explore ideas further together rather than the whole class having to share a smaller laptop screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissa Grant, eLearning Leader at Takapuna Primary School and Promethean Grant Panellist, commented: “The standard of the entries has been phenomenal. It was a privilege to be part of the judging process and see first-hand how creative schools were in demonstrating how the technology would transform teaching and learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. However, we did have to make some very tough decisions.”</p>
<p>“As a company we are really pleased that we could ease the financial pressure of 11 schools across Australia and New Zealand and deliver next-generation technology for both staff and students. We firmly believe finances shouldn’t be a barrier to accessing technology which enhances teaching and learning experiences, and that is why we chose to launch the Promethean Grant,” added Alistair Hayward, Promethean’s Head of UKI and ANZ markets.</p>
<p>Torbay School has been using its ActivPanel since the start of the school year and has received ActivPanel training as part of the win. As a front of class display, the ActivPanel acts as a collaborative learning centre, and can connect with other devices in the classroom such as laptops and tablets; enabling students to complete tasks from the screen on a handheld device, or even take turns at the front of the classroom using the touchscreen functionality.</p>

<p>Owairaka District School in Mount Albert, Auckland has won a state-of-the-art education technology package, after entering a Trans-Tasman school competition.

<p>Joanne Green, teacher at Owairaka District School said: &#8220;We are so thrilled to have won an ActivPanel &#8211; something that will significantly strengthen the collaborative side of our learning. Digital devices provide great tools for our students in their day to day tasks, which include their own learning blogs. So, having access to an ActivPanel will allow groups of students to work together on learning activities, whilst also allowing students and teachers to share and model work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Importantly, it will help to engage all students, no matter what their learning needs are. We are so excited!&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissa Grant, eLearning Leader at Takapuna Primary School and Promethean Grant Panellist, commented: “The standard of the entries has been phenomenal.

Putaruru College staff were well aware of the benefits that technology can bring, but as a low-decile centre they didn’t have the budget to make large investments to modernise their classrooms.

<p><strong>Key considerations</strong></p>
<p>Putaruru College staff felt that the Promethean ActivPanel would suit their needs as they were looking for a flexible hardware and software package that could support learning across the curriculum. The effort put in by staff and students saw Promethean Case Studies ANZ Grant Winners them win an ActivPanel, which they decided to place in the library so that everyone would have a chance to use it.</p>
