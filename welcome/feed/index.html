As an edtech provider, Promethean understands the importance of coming together to minimize the impact on students’ learning. Here’s a look at how we are addressing COVID-19 as a whole:</p>
<p><u>Customer and Employee Safety:</u></p>
<p>At Promethean, our top priority is keeping our employees, customers, and community as safe as possible. To make this happen, Promethean is following the guidance given by the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Health Organization</a> and relevant local government policies and guidelines on keeping our <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/workplace-school-and-home-guidance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workplace</a> safe.</p>
<p>Based on the recommendations, we have suspended employee travel and customer visitations to our global offices. We also are embracing a “video-first” company culture – using our videoconferencing capabilities to ensure we remain connected with customers in lieu of in-person meetings.</p>
<p>We are strongly encouraging our employees to telecommute. For employees who have traveled to Level 3 countries or have been exposed to COVID-19 in any capacity, we encourage them to adhere to the recommended 14-day self-quarantine period.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have set up a cross-functional COVID-19 response team. This team has the needed contingency plans to ensure our business continuity under any circumstances.</p>
<p><u>Helping Schools and Students</u></p>
<p>Promethean has long supported mobile and virtual learning by helping teachers teach and students learn from anywhere, at any time.</p>
<p>As educational systems tackle COVID-19, Promethean’s cloud-based lesson planning and delivery software, <a href="https://classflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ClassFlow</a>, is free and available to schools and teachers around the world.</p>
<p>Through ClassFlow, teachers will be able to access a huge range of educational resources. Teachers will be able to share lesson content with students who are working from home or other remote locations. And, students will have the chance to complete tasks and work with teachers through the cloud to ensure learning continues during the closure.</p>
<p>We are keeping those affected by this virus in our thoughts. If you have any questions or need additional assistance from Promethean, <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/about-us/contact-us/">please contact us.</a></p>

<p><strong>(SEATTLE, February 11, 2020) – </strong>In 2014, California’s Palmdale School District faced a major issue across its schools – a digital divide. With the help of global education technology provider, <a href="http://www.prometheanworld.com/">Promethean®</a>, the district was able to execute its “Palmdale Promise” initiative to successfully level the technology playing field across its district and provide more opportunities for all 19,000-plus students and teachers to improve engagement and outcomes.</p>
<p>“When we began this initiative, some of our school sites were fairly well-outfitted with technology and others had absolutely nothing. There was a huge disparity,” said Christine Jones, coordinator of educational technology at Palmdale School District. “By partnering with Promethean, our team has been able to deliver on the Palmdale Promise and give all students equal access to technology, regardless of their school.”</p>
<p>Palmdale reviewed Promethean’s signature interactive flat panel, the ActivPanel, against competing solutions and it was the preferred panel over others.</p>
<p>Promethean’s tablet-like user interface enables teachers and students to collaborate with ease and includes Promethean’s ClassFlow™ cloud-based lesson delivery software,  allowing teachers to build their own interactive lessons.</p>
<p>Today, classrooms throughout Palmdale School District have ActivPanels mounted on mobile stands, untethering teachers from the front of the class and freeing them up to manage lessons throughout the room. The stands also make it simple to raise or lower the panels depending on classroom needs.</p>
<p>“It’s important to us that our solutions are both user-friendly and flexible – giving teachers the tools they need to make lessons and activities their own,” said Steve Halliwell, Chief Product Officer at Promethean. “With Palmdale, we helped them build a student-centered environment that translates district-wide and will continue to partner with them to provide ongoing professional development and resources for teachers.”</p>
<p>Palmdale School District provides regular training, which includes lessons from full-time Promethean coaches focused on ways to better use features of the ActivPanel and ClassFlow. Sometimes these sessions take place during “Tech Tuesdays” and “Tech Thursdays” after-school sessions designed to help teachers better implement technology. And, many teachers are doing just that – having enthusiastically incorporated the new solutions into their everyday lessons.</p>
<p>“Our teachers have widely adopted the use of the Promethean panels in their classrooms. Having immediate access to digital content and resources has enabled them to quickly create and present more exciting, rich lessons for their students,” said Jones. “On our annual district technology survey, student engagement has increased an average of 22% districtwide with a few sites reporting a more than 40% increase. You just cannot minimize the effect of happy, engaged teachers on the learning environment!”</p>
<p>At the upcoming 2020 TCEA Convention &amp; Exposition, Promethean will exhibit the latest version of the ActivPanel, the Elements Series, along with its continuously growing suite of classroom products. Attendees can experience its newly updated award-winning Escape Room, in-booth sessions on creative ways to incorporate technology into the classroom, and various opportunities for educators to win an ActivPanel for their classrooms.</p>
<p>To learn more about Promethean at TCEA, please visit booth 1627, or visit <a href="http://www.PrometheanWorld.com">www.PrometheanWorld.com</a>. The show will be held February 3-7, 2020, in Austin, Texas.</p>

<li>Teachers are ready to use edtech in the classroom, with more than 70 percent indicating they know more about technology than their students.</li>
<li>More than half of those surveyed believe online content and resources will see the greatest classroom growth in the next five years.</li>
<li>Most administrators surveyed indicate they evaluate edtech success by level of student engagement, teacher feedback, and overall results.</li>
<li>Reducing the student achievement gap is a top priority for administrators and teachers alike (57 percent versus 54 percent).</li>
</ul>

<p>“Just as the classroom is a collaborative environment for students, teachers and administrators must come together to determine technology’s role for their respective schools,” said Cheryl Miller, Chief Marketing Officer for Promethean. “Our 2019 State of Technology report is designed to help school systems see the collective challenges districts face when making technology decisions and help them better prioritize their edtech investments.”</p>
<p>“It is clear technology is the future of education, but schools and their districts are still unclear on how to implement it in the classroom and keep it up-to-date, rather than play catch-up,” said Hailey Philpotts, Miami-Date County Public Schools Teacher. “Promethean’s 2019 State of Technology report reaffirms my opinion of the state of edtech and what needs to be done.”</p>

<p>Following extensive user research, Promethean designed the ActivPanel Elements series to deliver innovation and ease-of-use that matters to teachers and students, as well as the security and manageability trusted by IT professionals and administrators.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p>&#8220;For more than 20 years, Promethean&#8217;s history of teachers designing technology solutions for teachers, combined with countless research, design and test hours, has led to the creation of the Elements series,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Vin Riera</span>, chief executive officer at Promethean. &#8220;The new ActivPanel Elements series is purpose-built to make teaching more efficient and enjoyable while enriching student learning experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the Elements series employs a groundbreaking unified menu to control all apps and settings on the panel, and source switching across connected devices. This means teachers can move seamlessly between content and resources with greater confidence and less training time required, and no need to manually switch inputs across hardware.</p>
<p>Another powerful feature is Promethean&#8217;s proprietary new Vellum™ writing technology, which brings together elements of hardware and software to make the writing experience natural and enjoyable. &#8220;Vellum technology brings the instant whiteboard to life with unparalleled free-form writing, pinch-zoom navigation, and pre-loaded teaching tools,&#8221; Riera added.</p>
<p>Now available in <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>, the <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/products/interactive-displays/activpanel-elements-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ActivPanel Elements series</a> includes Classroom Essential apps. At the touch of a button, teachers can use the infinite canvas on the highly intuitive Whiteboard app to instantly supplement lessons. They can also draw, highlight, and annotate over any content from any source with the Annotate app, and add excitement to activities with the customizable Spinner and Timer apps.</p>
<p>The ActivPanel Elements series also empowers secure, multi-device collaboration via screen sharing across the ActivPanel, smartphones, Chromebooks<sup>™</sup>, tablets, and laptops. This frees teachers to move anywhere in the classroom and create small/large group interactions that drive student engagement.</p>
<p>The ActivPanel Elements series includes Promethean&#8217;s award-winning, interactive lesson delivery software products. Both <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/products/lesson-delivery-software/activinspire">ActivInspire®</a> and <a href="https://www.prometheanworld.com/products/lesson-delivery-software/classflow/">ClassFlow®</a> are Promethean created and supported and available without an additional subscription.

<p>Judged by a panel of experienced educators, one of the guest judges will be Promethean’s Senior Education Consultant, Dr John Collick. Looking explicitly for creative and innovative energy in entries, the judges will be giving the schools a chance to show how winning an ActivPanel will transform their teaching and learning programmes.</p>
<p>Launched in the UKI and ANZ markets in 2017, and extended throughout other international markets in 2018, the Promethean Grant has proven to be a huge success by providing schools with an opportunity to win the latest technology.</p>

<p>Promethean will be embracing the opportunity to use GESS Dubai as a regional platform to preview forthcoming advancements to its global market leading ActivPanel. Building on Promethean’s 20-year history of developing solutions for the education market, the ActivPanel has become the epitome of collaboration and interactivity in classroom environments. Providing schools with increased flexibility and control to align technology investment with budget and ICT strategy, this exclusive opportunity will encourage visitors of GESS to view the product developments and provide feedback to help shape the future of the range.</p>
<p>Jon McDermott, Promethean’s Head of Central Asia and the Middle East, commented: “GESS is the ideal platform for us to show our EdTech solutions on a regional scale. We wanted to bring our most recent research and development advancements to the visitors at GESS to show them our evolving product offering and to see how we can make it even better for those who will be using it. It is a perfect opportunity for us to gather feedback from those who experience the classroom environment daily.”</p>
<p>Promethean’s Senior Education Consultant, Dr. John Collick, will be delivering a series of sessions throughout the duration of GESS Dubai. On Tuesday 26<sup>th</sup> February, at 2pm in the Future Learning conference room, Dr. John Collick will be looking at the ideology of the ‘Cyberstudent’. Technology has become an integral part of the modern world, stemming from personal lives, to education, to the workplace leading Dr. John Collick to discuss the challenges of technology, AI and the rise of the Cyberstudent.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dr. John Collick will be delivering a daily session on Stand I20, entitled ‘AI, Identity and the Future of Learning’, paying close attention to what the future holds in an ever-changing technological world, and where education could possibly see itself in the next few years.</p>
<p>“In today’s modern world predicting what will happen next is difficult. In terms of technology, the rise of AI is having an impact on learning and development in many different aspects of life. It is important that as education technology providers, we have future proof solutions that protect investment and ensure users get the most out of their technology,” said Dr. John Collick.</p>
<p>Alongside Dr. John Collick and the award-winning ActivPanel, there will be activity on the stand from Promethean Advocates and Promethean’s content partners, including teachers from the International School of Creative Science, who will be celebrating their ‘love for learning’. Visitors at GESS are encouraged to visit the stand to learn more about the practical applications of the ActivPanel from educational peers.
